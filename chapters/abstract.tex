We present an implementation of a load sharing algorithm between a human and a robot, designed to work in an indoor cluttered environment. Human robot cooperation is applied, using information exchange through forces and torque applied to the jointly handled object. The work is set within the master-slave paradigm and combines an admittance controller with obstacle avoidance to ensure collision free trajectories at all times. We derive the implementation from existing literature and validate the working algorithm on a mobile manipulator, consisting of a Clearpath Ridgeback platform, a Universal Robot 10 and a Robotiq three finger gripper.
