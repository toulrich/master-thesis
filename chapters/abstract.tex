We present an implementation of a load-sharing algorithm between a human and a robot partner, designed to jointly carry an object in an indoor cluttered environment, of which the robot has no prior. We review the state of human-robot interaction in general and deploy cooperation, using information exchange through forces and torque applied to the jointly handled object. The work is set within the master-slave paradigm and combines an admittance controller with obstacle avoidance to ensure pro-active behaviour on the robot side and collision free trajectories at all times. We derive the implementation from existing literature and validate the working algorithm on a mobile manipulator, consisting of a Clearpath Ridgeback platform, a Universal Robot 10 and a Robotiq three finger gripper.
